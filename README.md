Path Tracer: Project of Advanced rendering
======================

**University of Pennsylvania, Advanced Computer Graphics**

**The code is implemented according to principle and source code of book "Physically Based Rendering: From Theory to Implementation, Third version", by Matt Pharr, Wenzel Jakob, and Greg Humphreys**

##Main features include:     
####Monte Carlo Path tracing 
####Multiple Importance Sampling
####Different Integrators, including Naive Integrator, Direct Light Integrator and FullLight Integrator
####Differenet BSDF Models,including Lambertian,Orennayar,Specular, Glossy, Transmission, and Microfacet
####Different Light sources, including arealight, pointlight, spotlight and distant light
####Acceleration Structure, including BVH tree and K-D Tree  
####Len-based Camera
####Implicit surface rendering
